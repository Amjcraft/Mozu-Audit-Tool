nodejs-boilerplate
==================

Create Apps with Node.JS + Express 4 and Handlebars.js

## Getting Started

This boilerplate requires [Express 4.0](http://github.com/visionmedia/express) and [hbs](https://github.com/donpark/hbs), a Express view engine wrapper for Handlebars. Install project dependencies via:

```shell
npm install
```

And run the app:

```shell
node app.js
```

## Build Static HTML

The idea of ​​this is boilerplate also generate a static HTML pages generated by all Node.js. For that use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) and run Grunt task:

```shell
grunt build
```

One 'build' directory will be created in the root of your project with all HTML's processed and their rightful assets. The .htaccess file is responsible for doing the rewrite your URL's assets.
